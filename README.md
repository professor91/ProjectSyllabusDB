# ProjectSyllabusDB

The Project aims to present syllabus of all the courses, offered Delhi University, in a more interactive manner than pdfs.

I started this project coz I believe that if you study the syllabus before you study the course you will get a pretty good idea about what to expect ahead in the 
course, and where it can take you in your career. And I think many of you feel the same.
