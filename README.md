# ProjectSyllabusDB

The Project aims to present syllabus of all the courses, offered Delhi University, in a more interactive manner than pdfs.

At first, I made it for fun but then I realized since I rarely attend classes, it helps to catch up with the class in no time as now I know what all stuff I should be expecting and on top of that I don't need to scroll tens of pages of pdfs to find the syllabus of a course, it's just one click away now.

# What to do

I am gonna need couple of hands because this one's a big task, anyone who want to be a part of this project and contribute to it just hit me up on my mail @
keshavandteam@gmail.com and let me know which task you are taking up. You can also message me on discord (Id:- Professor#0785)

Following are the tasks that we need to do: 
  
<h3> Collect data & Prepare main Webpage for a course: </h3>
  Get the latest pdf of the syllabus of a programme and code main webpage for the courses. You need to know HTML & CSS at the least if you wanna do this one.
  
  Here I have listed all the UG programmes offered by DU and their status. Please go through to get a picture of the progress of the project.

<h3> Validate the Content of the Webpage </h3>
  The person who is enrolled knows better than anyone the syllabus of the course, so if you are enrolled in a course you can validate if the information 
  on the website is correct and up to date or not.
